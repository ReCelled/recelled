## Addons

Installing addons like plugins and themes is very humane. ReCelled Works out of box with replugged
plugins, just install them the same way as on replugged.

## Can I use BetterDiscord plugins?

Yes'nt. You can kindof but its truly unsupported. You just Inject better discord after recelled
hoping it works! (Works mostly)

Let me remind you again, this is not supported by better discord or recelled no might have
unexpected results.

### Is this against the ToS?

Long story short... **yes**.
